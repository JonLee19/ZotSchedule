Instantiating new class each academic term

Pros
-can define student-course relationship simply
-can have 


Cons

-blank classes are not conceptually meaningful

-repeated courses cannot be just copied
	-will have full copies of each iteration of a class!

-can't see all the instances of a class easily (has to search)
	-no access to shared info across all offerings of a subject


Decision:
Student will be related to subjects, as their record only needs to hold the academic transcript- individual classes can be loaded for users once requested/needed!
